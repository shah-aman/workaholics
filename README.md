# Workation Connect Platform

## Description

**Workation Connect** is a decentralized platform that enables people on workations (working vacations) in different cities to connect, communicate, and share experiences using a Web3 technology stack. The platform hosts city-based servers where groups of people located in a specific city can join, interact, and collaborate while enjoying their workation.

## Key Features

### 1. **Decentralized City Servers** 
- Users can host or join city-based servers.
- A server acts as a community hub for everyone on a workation in a specific city.
- Users can share experiences, arrange meetups, and collaborate on projects within a server.

### 2. **Web3 Integration**
- User identities are managed securely and transparently using blockchain technology.
- Cryptographic tokens could potentially be used for in-app transactions or as a reward mechanism.
- Smart contracts ensure transparent and trustless interactions within the community.

### 3. **Real-Time Communication**
- Leveraging push protocol, users receive real-time notifications and can engage in real-time chat.
- Direct and group messaging options for seamless communication.
- Users can create and join topic-based channels within a city server.

### 4. **Experience Sharing**
- Users can post about their experiences, reviews, and tips related to local amenities, workspaces, and leisure activities.
- Visual content (photos and videos) support for enhanced sharing.
- Engage with posts via comments, likes, and shares.

## Technology Stack

### Web3
- **Blockchain**: To manage decentralized user identities, and potentially handle in-platform token transactions.
- **Smart Contracts**: For transparent and secure interactions and transactions within the platform.
- **IPFS**: For decentralized storage of data and media files, ensuring data persistence and availability without relying on centralized servers.

### Communication Protocol
- **Push Protocol**: For real-time, bidirectional communication to support chat functionality and instant notifications.
  
### Frontend
- **React**: For building a user-friendly interface.
- **Web3.js or Ethers.js**: To interact with blockchain and manage user wallets.
- **Socket.IO**: To manage real-time web socket communication for chat and notifications.

### Backend
- **Node.js**: To handle server-side logic.
- **Express**: For creating the API.
- **OrbitDB**: As a serverless, distributed, peer-to-peer database that uses IPFS as its data storage and runs on top of Ethereum blockchain for managing identities.

## User Workflow

1. **Server Creation/Joining**
   - User can create a new city server or join an existing one.
   - The creation and management of servers are done through smart contracts.
   
2. **Profile Management**
   - Users manage their profiles using decentralized identity management.
   - Profiles contain information about their professional skills, interests, and workation durations.

3. **Communication**
   - Users can post updates, share experiences, and communicate via real-time chat within a city server.
   - They can join channels, send direct messages, and get notifications about new messages, events, and updates.

4. **Experience & Knowledge Sharing**
   - Users can create posts, share images, and videos about their experiences.
   - They can provide tips, advice, and recommendations related to working and living in the city.

5. **Meetups & Events**
   - Users can create, find, and join local meetups and events.
   - RSVP to events, communicate with event organizers, and provide feedback post-event.
